# Engineering Culture Matters

The best code is written by engineers who feel valued, empowered, and connected to the mission.

## What Makes a Great Engineering Culture?

It's not about ping pong tables or free snacks. It's about:

- **Psychological safety** — The freedom to take risks without fear
- **Autonomy** — Ownership over your work and decisions
- **Mastery** — Opportunities to grow and improve
- **Purpose** — Understanding the impact of your work

### The Feedback Loop

Great culture creates a positive feedback loop:

1. Engineers feel supported → They take ownership
2. They take ownership → They write better code
3. Better code → Better products
4. Better products → Engineers feel valued

## Building Culture Remotely

In a distributed world, culture requires intentional effort:

- **Async-first communication** — Write things down
- **Rituals** — Regular sync points that matter
- **Recognition** — Celebrate wins, big and small
