The world is changing faster than we can comprehend. AI is automating everything—code, design, customer service. But writing? That's different.

## The Last Human Skill

In an age where machines can generate perfect prose, the value isn't in the words themselves. It's in the perspective, the experience, the humanity behind them.

This is about locking in my thoughts before they vanish. Before the AI noise drowns out the signal. Before I forget what it was like to think, struggle, and learn.
