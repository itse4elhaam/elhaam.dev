We've spent decades perfecting user interfaces. Beautiful buttons. Intuitive navigation. Delightful animations. But what happens when humans aren't the primary users anymore?

## The Death of Interfaces

AI agents don't need buttons. They don't care about hover states or smooth transitions. They consume APIs, read schemas, parse JSON.

The future isn't about making things easier for humans—it's about making systems that AI can orchestrate.

## What This Means for Engineers

We're not building for clicks anymore. We're building for agents. For automation. For a world where the interface is invisible.
