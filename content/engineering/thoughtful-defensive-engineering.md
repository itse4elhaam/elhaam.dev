Perfect code doesn't exist. But resilient code does.

## Defensive by Design

Every function is a contract. Every input is a potential attack. Every assumption is a future bug.

Thoughtful engineering isn't about writing less code—it's about anticipating what goes wrong before it does.

## Principles That Matter

1. **Validate everything** — Trust nothing, verify everything
2. **Fail fast and loudly** — Silent failures are the worst failures
3. **Guard clauses over nesting** — Early returns save sanity
4. **Types as documentation** — Let the compiler catch bugs

## The Payoff

When production breaks at 3 AM, defensive code is the difference between a quick rollback and a disaster recovery plan.
