The purpose of this document is to outline some changes required in the design overall

- The current black color right now feels too dark for most people, need to make it a bit more dark so that if goes better with the orange theme color
- I donot want a facny header in this website, remove the header and the top portion should be a center aligned thing named like this

"Elhaam Basheer Chaudhry"
"A thoughful engineering blog" - this is rotated too much right now ||| and this would just have a toggle button along with it

---

similary I donot think that footer should be this elabtorate and should have two columns

it should just have a singe column in which my name is written introduction and it mentions that I have like thoughtful engineering and I do thoughtful engineering at truedevs.tech along with my team or similar - this should be well written

The purpose of this above footer is that this can become a lead generation thing for truedevs.tech but it should not look like it that much, it should be subtle but affective

---

I don't like how the date is positioned right now with the blogs in the homepage, this needs to be better, right now it is making the whole blog box look bad, need to find a better alignment that makes this look better

--

The website overall should have a toggle that ui.shadcn.com has as well, the toggle basically allows the user to toggle between full width and centered width thingy.

Also the overall font size of the blogs on the homepage is pretty small, need to increase it, the idea is that this should be the main thing that catches user's attention

The font is not very readble on the /blog page, need to make it so that it is very readbale and makes the users read the blog easily

Secondly, you can look at the website of pragmatic engineer for inspiration

The color through which the text is selected needs to be customnised, it should always be a light premium variant of the theme color in both dark and light modes

also hate the share button right now, it has to more premium than that please

---

Apart from these, after doing these changes, as a senior UI UX expert with a strong background in blogs, suggest me other 80/20 type changes, which have 20% effort but can improve the UX by 80% for this to go live and save them in UX.md

---

In addition to the hover affect of changing the color, lets also add an underline (this should be customized and feel premium)

---

To conclude, need to make this design minimal and easy to navigate with premium feeling and UX
