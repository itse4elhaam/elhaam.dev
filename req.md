# User Requirements for elhaam.dev

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js (Ensure usage of the **latest version**).
- **Rendering Strategy**: SSR (Server-Side Rendering) is mandatory.
- **Content System**: Markdown-based.
  - Structure: Folders represent categories.
  - Files: Markdown files represent actual blog posts.
- **SEO**: Comprehensive SEO implementation ("all the SEO shit").

## 3. Design & Theme

- **Core Theme**: Must scream the subtitle "the thoughtful engineering blog".
- **Color Palette**: Follow the main color of [truedevs.tech](https://truedevs.tech/), unless a different theme better represents "thoughtful engineering".
- **Design Inspirations**:
  - [endler.dev](https://endler.dev): Simplicity, overall UX, footer intro/CTA ("We do thoughtful engineering...").
  - [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/): Premium look and feel. **Feature**: Text selection should show a "Share" tooltip.
  - [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/): Highlight section and SEO structure (not the design itself, which is considered "too old").
- **Anti-Patterns**:
  - [Web Dev Simplified Blog](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/): Do NOT copy. "Feels too robotic."

## 4. Planning & Strategy

- Plan as a senior software engineer with blog experience.
- Provide suggestions for Tech Stack and Planning specifically from an **SEO** and **User Engagement** POV.
- **Research**: Search and study similar GitHub repos, explicitly including [mre/endler.dev](https://github.com/mre/endler.dev).

## 5. Execution Goals

- **Timeline**: Ship **today**.
- **Outcome**: Put it on a domain and **START WRITING**.
